This little project creates a interactive circle on the users screen and allows them to manipulate and play with it in a variety of ways and after that I dont think you can really explain the art that it creates and allows the user to control

## Controls
A large part of this project is the interactability it allows the user to have over the ball and associated objects. Nevertheless, the controlls are:

- X Key, Re-enables the grid effect
